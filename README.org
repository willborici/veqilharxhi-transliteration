* Albanian-Vithkuqi Character Transliterator

Given the sui-generis Vithkuqi script developed by Albanian intellectual Naum Veqilarxhi
to write the Albanian language (at a time when it was being smothered by
foreign cultural influences), this transliteration program leverages the
font I have designed to render letters in either direction.
